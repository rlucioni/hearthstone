# hearthstone

Tools for studying Hearthstone cards. Data is provided by a [third-party API](http://hearthstoneapi.com/) hosted on [Mashape](https://market.mashape.com/omgvamp/hearthstone).

Create a `settings.yml` file at the root of the repo and put your Mashape application key in it. See `settings.yml.example` for an example.

Pull data from the API and save it to the `data` directory by executing `./get_data.py` from the root of the repo.
